# INFO 340 Project

Welcome to our INFO340 project! In this project, we designed and implemented an interactive web application that helps people navigate and learn about different countries, with a focus on tourism. Our website was created during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to help people discover new places and plan future trips. You can access the application at this link: https://covid-19-gtic.web.app.

Through this project, we practiced and mastered a range of skills, including:

- Creating new web pages from scratch
- Applying iterative development and modifying existing web projects
- Writing semantically rich and accessible HTML
- Using CSS to give pages complex formatting and layouts

We hosted our React project using Firebase Hosting, which provides fast and secure hosting for web applications.
