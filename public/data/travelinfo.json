You should make your application at least four weeks but not more than three months in advance of travel and provide full supporting documentation. <br>\nA negative COVID-19 test result is required for travelling to or transiting through Australia. Unless you are travelling on a quarantine-free flight from New Zealand, evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours or less before your scheduled departure must be provided to your airline. <br>\nBorder rules including eligibility criteria can change quickly.

There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br>\nYou\u2019re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you\u2019re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br>\nDue to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br>\nState quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia\u2019s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br>\nAll airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene.

See the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details including how to apply. <br>\nIf you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>\n*Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>\nThe Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation. <br>\nTemporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter \u2013 see the Department of Home Affairs \u2018Coming to Australia\u2019 web pages for more information. <br>\nDual Australian/British nationals and permanent residents in Australia are not generally permitted to leave Australia unless they qualify for an exemption. If you meet an exemption category or have a have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should do this as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time. <br>\nDetails on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. <br>\nIf you\u2019re a dual national or permanent resident who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia and have spent more time in the last 12 to 24 months outside Australia than within it, you do not need an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport. <br>\nIf you have not spent more time outside Australia than within it for the last 12 to 24 months, but still consider yourself to be ordinarily resident in another country, you can submit a request for a travel exemption.\n <br>\n  <br> \n*Internal Restrictions: <br>\nLockdown in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria extended and curfew imposed.

However, you should check any testing requirements of the airlines that you are boarding, the country you are travelling to, as well as any countries you may be transiting to see what testing requirement they may have to enable you to travel.

The land border with Paraguay is now open. <br>\n *Transiting: If you\u2019re in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should contact your embassy/ consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>\n *Sea ports: The Brazilian government has also imposed a ban on foreigners disembarking in any port or other maritime location on Brazilian territory regardless of their nationality. The restriction does not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national.Disembarking will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the country of residence. <br>\n *Transiting Brazil: Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land.\n  <br>\n  <br> \n Internal Restrictions:<br>\n *Travel in Brazil: Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country. There are additional local requirements for the compulsory use of masks in other places, such as shops and gyms, in various cities including S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Bras\u00edlia. Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine. <br>\n *Accommodation: Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available. <br>\n *Public spaces and services: The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them.

If you\u2019re issued a visa to travel to China you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email.  In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from a Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports.  On 15 March the Chinese authorities announced a relaxation of certain requirements for visa applicants who can prove inoculation with a vaccine produced in China. Travellers who have not had a vaccine are still able to enter China under the existing, limited circumstances described above.  A limited number of international flights are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi\u2019an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>\n*Health checks on arrival: All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment.  Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact your local Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus.  Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>\nFollow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>\n\u2022        unless directed by the authorities you\u2019re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you\u2019re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>\n\u2022        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>\n\u2022        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br>\n\u2022        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>\n\u2022        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>\n\u2022        if you\u2019re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>\nFailure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.\n  <br>\n  <br> \nInternal Restrictions: <br>\n *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations \u2013 such locations are also increasingly needing the use of \u2018health kit code\u2019 apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br>\nRestrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>\nThe possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br>\nThere have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients. <br>\n*Be prepared for your plans to change: No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.<br>\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.\nPlan ahead and make sure you: can access money: understand what your insurance will cover: can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned\n",

Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br>\n *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n Internal Restrictions: <br>\n *Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place.

The only permitted exceptions are for the transport of essential workers and supplies, and certain other categories with official permission.<br>\nFace masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles. <br>\nVisitors are allowed to hire cars should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. <br>\nCheck with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed. <br>\n*Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open but to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. <br>\nCampsites are open also to a limited capacity.<br>\nMedical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and \u201ccasas particulares\u201d. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and the medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. <br>\nHotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators. <br>\n",

Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia. Arrivals must then complete 7 days mandatory self-quarantine. <br>\nFrom 7 June 2021, all passengers arriving in, departing from or transiting Ethiopia must validate their COVID-19 RT PCR test via the <a href=\"https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/trusted-testing/signup/\">Africa Union Trusted Travel</a> or <a href=\"https://globalhaven.org/travel-guide/\">UNDP Global Haven</a>  systems (you will need to register an account on one of these sites). These systems will generate a digital Trusted Travel reference code for your test, which must be presented. Paper certificates will not be accepted without a digital reference code from 1 July 2021. You should arrange to take a private test.<br>\n*Transiting Ethiopia: If you are planning to travel via Ethiopia to reach the UK, you should be aware that restrictions apply. Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>\nPassengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked \u201ctransit shuttle bus\u201d from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>\nPassengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. See below. <br>\nIf you have any further questions, you should contact your airline. <br>\n*Screening on arrival: Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Arriving passengers are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate with digital reference code prior to entry (see Entry to Ethiopia). Additional screening may include temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials. This will include checks on recent travel to affected areas and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below). <br>\nAnyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and will be tested. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 will be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. <br>\nAnyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: All passengers arriving into the country (except diplomats) are required to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate, dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) . Only RT 2PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight. <br>\nAll passengers will be subject to 7 days mandatory self-isolation. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival. <br>\nDiplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate. Where they do so, they will need to self-isolate at their residence for 7 days. Where they do not present a negative test certificate, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. <br>\n*Land border quarantine: Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders. <br>\nThose crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) with digital reference code (see Entry to Ethiopia) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted. <br>\nAnyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and a further test. The standard of isolation centres varies significantly around the country. <br>\nYou should check for the latest information with local authorities before travelling to the border.\n*Visas: You will need a visa with a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia. <br>\nThe Ethiopian authorities have temporarily suspended visas-on-arrival and e-visas. All visitors must get a visa from the Ethiopian Embassy closest to their place of legal residence before travelling. You will need to show a valid visa before boarding your flight and upon entry. Holders of valid Diplomatic ID, Ethiopian Temporary Residents Permits or Ethiopian Origin ID (Yellow Cards) will continue to be allowed entry.<br>\nThe penalty for overstaying your visit visa is $US10 per person per day. If you overstay you will have to pay your fine in full before you are able to leave Ethiopia. Visitors entering Ethiopia without a valid travel document and Ethiopian visa may encounter imprisonment and/or pay six months or more overstay penalty in USD.<br>\nTo obtain a business visa for Ethiopia you may need prior approval from the <a href=\"http://www.invea.gov.et/\">Ethiopian Immigration, Nationality and Vital Events Agency office</a> before submitting your application to the Ethiopian Embassy. You should check the latest instructions with your nearest Ethiopian Embassy.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nInternal Restrictions: <br> \n*Travel to the airport: You should arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure time. You will need a printed copy of your itinerary, e-ticket or boarding pass in order to be allowed to enter the airport terminal. You should check whether you need a negative COVID-19 test to travel to your destination; this may be requested before your departure. You should comply with all local restrictions.<br>\n*Local coronavirus measures: Government directives to help limit the spread of COVID-19 currently include:<br>\n\u2022        Any person known to be infected with coronavirus is prohibited from entering the country, mixing or meeting with other people in any way that may spread the virus<br>\n\u2022        Gatherings (including religious gatherings, weddings and funerals) are limited to 50 people.

They are then required to undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport. You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your accommodation. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: From 14 August, travellers arriving from the UK are requested to spend 3 days (a change from 6) in self-isolation at a government-provided hotel, with further COVID-19 tests on the third day (The date of arrival counts as Day 0.) Children over the age of 12 will be asked to quarantine without a guardian \u2013 the Japanese authorities may offer some flexibility on this point, but this is not guaranteed. If the tests are negative, travellers will be allowed to continue 14 days\u2019 self-isolation as set out below. Travellers coming from various other countries must also undertake between 3 and 10 days of self-isolation at a government-provided facility, with COVID-19 tests at designated intervals.

This pledge will also ask individuals to refrain from using public transport; install Japan\u2019s COVID-19 tracing app; maintain location data for 14 days via their smartphone mapping application; and agree to disclose location data if requested by the quarantine authority. Failure to comply with these requests could lead to an individual being subject to detention under the Quarantine Act. It could also lead to their name and relevant information related to reducing the spread of infection being released; and for foreign nationals, possible revocation of their status of residence and subsequent deportation. If someone does not wish to sign this pledge, they will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days at a place designated by the quarantine authority. These measures will remain in place for the foreseeable future. <br>\nMore details on Japan\u2019s current quarantine rules are available <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html#section3\">here</a>.

        "info": "Latest News: COVID-19 lockdown will be extended until 2 September (Xinhua, 19.08.2021).\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  International Restrictions: <br>\n*Entry to Laos: The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from a country with cases of COVID-19, including the UK. However, the Lao authorities may consider granting special entry permission for foreigners (e.g. experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are needed for essential projects) who wish to come to Laos. <br>\nEntry procedures for Laos visa-holders: <br>\n\u2022  all foreigners must present a Certificate of Entry (issued by the MFA); a completed Health Declaration form; and a \u2018Fit to Fly\u2019 Certificate issued no more than 72 hours prior to travel. You should arrange to take a private test <br>\n\u2022  all arrivals will be subject to a COVID-19 test at their own expense. Positive cases will be admitted to hospital for treatment <br>\n\u2022  all negative cases have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies) <br>\nThe application form for the health declaration is available on the official website for the <a href=\"http://www.mofa.gov.la/index.php\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</a> \nDue to the impacts of coronavirus the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to extend visas in country and be flexible if visas cannot be extended before the due date for operational reasons because of the new regulations. <br>\n*Screening on arrival: There is compulsory testing for COVID-19 on arrival in Laos at your own expense. Those testing positive will be admitted to hospital for treatment. <br>\nEnhanced health screening is in place at border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam where restricted access is allowed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air. <br>\nAnybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Mahosot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103). <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: All arrivals testing negative for COVID-19 will have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations, which include hotels (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies). A mandatory tracking device is fitted on arrival (a rental fee applies) to be worn during quarantine. <br>\nAll travellers must have insurance covering COVID-19; a suitable policy is available for purchase on arrival. <br>\n*Testing on departure: There is no compulsory COVID testing on departure from Laos. You should check all conditions of air ticket purchases carefully with airlines as some may need evidence of a negative COVID test to travel. <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n Internal Restrictions: <br>\n*Travel in Laos: Some restrictions on travel within Laos have been extended until 3 August 2021. According to the Lao authorities, public transport by land and air is permitted between provinces where community transmission has not been identified. The government has announced that travel from Vientiane Capital is permitted for people who can show they have been fully vaccinated before travel. However given the low number of people who currently meet this requirement there are few public transport options available in practice. Some limited domestic flight services have resumed for eligible travellers who are fully vaccinated and have permission to travel from the Lao authorities (permission is also required for anyone if travelling with unvaccinated children). <br>\nYou should monitor local official announcements for guidance in the latest restrictions. There may be short notice lockdowns introduced in provinces with reports of COVID-19 outbreaks. <br>\n*Thailand land border: The Thai government has announced that all Thailand-Laos border crossings are restricted until further notice, including the Friendship Bridge between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Commercial goods are permitted to cross at present and there have been exemptions for medical emergencies at the discretion of the Laos and Thai medical authorities.\nIf you want to travel to Thailand, you must <a href=\"https://coethailand.mfa.go.th/regis/step?language=en\">apply for permission to travel via the Royal Thai Government\u2019s online platform</a>\n. You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Thai <a href=\"\"></a>\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, the<a href=\"http://vientiane.thaiembassy.org/en/\">Royal Thai Embassy in Vientiane</a> , and the Thai <a href=\"https://www.moph.go.th/\">Ministry of Public Health</a>\n*Accommodation: Hotels and private rental accommodation is available throughout Laos, although a number of hotels/hostels are currently closed due to reduced tourist numbers. You should arrange accommodation in advance of travel. <br>\n*Public places and services: The Lao authorities have announced an easing of lockdown restrictions in provinces with no COVID-19 infections. Most businesses (including gyms/spas, sports facilities, night markets, tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping malls, retail shops and food markets) may open if COVID preventative measures are in place. These may include providing alcohol gel, face masks being worn, 1m physical distancing and checking temperatures. However, some entertainment venues remain closed and the sale of alcohol is prohibited. <br>\nLarge social gatherings, weddings and traditional events are not permitted. <br>\nIn Vientiane Capital many of the COVID-19 prevention measures and lockdown restrictions have been extended until 3 August as community transmission remains a risk. Many businesses, restaurants, shopping malls, retail shops and food markets may open if COVID prevention measures are in place. The main restrictions are: <br>\n\u2022        Vientiane Capital has introduced a zoning system, with different parts of the city graded red, yellow or green - restrictions are heaviest in the red areas. These zones may change over time <br>\n\u2022        Travel in and out of Vientiane Capital is prohibited from infected areas <br>\n\u2022        Meetings, events or gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited <br>\n\u2022        Some entertainment venues, karaoke venues, bars, internet cafes are closed <br>\n\u2022        Entrance to some commercial premises requires that you are fully vaccinated, please confirm in advance and carry evidence of your vaccine record. <br>\nFurther measures may be introduced at short notice, including measures applying to individual provinces. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities. <br>\n* If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. <br>\nPlan ahead and make sure you: can access money; understand what your insurance will cover; can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n ",

If the positivity rate is higher than 10%, 14 day quarantine must be observed at destination. Use of masks is mandatory while travelling by air and sea. <br>\nThose who have not received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine can only travel to inhabited islands with guesthouses if: <br>\n\u2022        60% of the island population have completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>\n\u2022        95% of all employees in the tourism sector of the island have completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>\n\u2022        90% of the island population over the age of 60% has completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>\nYou will be regarded as having completed two doses only after 14 days have passed since you received your second dose of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine. <br>\nUnvaccinated visitors that travel to islands that meet the above vaccine coverage criteria must take a PCR test 7 days after arrival. As the Greater Male\u2019 area does not meet the criteria specified above, only tourists who have completed two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine can stay at hotels and guesthouses in the area. <br>\nTourists can travel between islands and resorts that do not have COVID-19 cases and are not subject to monitoring for COVID-19, but need prior approval for inter-island travel from splitstays@tourism.gov.mv.

If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=\"http://www.btsc.or.kr/\">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>\nEven if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test issued within 72 hours prior to departure. You will also need to take PCR tests on arrival and on day 6 or 7, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>\nQuarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for 14 days. All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>\nIf you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities.  <br>\nFor more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). \nDemonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>\n*Data collection: Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>\nMake sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.\n   <br>\n  <br>\nInternal Restrictions: <br>\n*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. Results are usually issued via text message within 1-2 days.\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you do not need treatment, you will generally be moved to a quarantine centre until you have received two consecutive negative tests. If you do need treatment, you will be moved to a hospital or treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. <br>\nIndividuals testing positive may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. You may face additional costs if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>\nAnyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>\n*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won. <br>\nSouth Korea currently has a four-level national social distancing scale.\nFor full details of the current restrictions and requirements you should check the South Korea <ahref=\"https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030\">Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA)</a>\n and <a href=\"http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/\">Ministry of Health and Welfare  </a>\n websites (English).

        "info": "Latest News: \n  <br>\n  <br>\nInternational Restrictions:<br>\n*Entry to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: All air arrivals (except from Ascension) to St Helena are required to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours before travelling to the island. They are also subject to compulsory quarantine for 10 days and will be tested on arrival and at the end of quarantine. The only exception are individuals travelling from Ascension who have been resident for 14 days or more prior to travel. <br>\nThere are no other entry restrictions in force and foreign nationals are permitted to enter St Helena provided they meet the immigration rules. <br>\nAll travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of Her Majesty\u2019s Armed Forces. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control (Ascension) Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. Applicants should be aware that their applications may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat on the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked. <br>\nAll air arrivals to Ascension (except from St Helena) are required to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 3 days before travelling to the island. All arrivals to Ascension that have travelled from a COVID-19 infected area within the last 14 days, or travelled with others who have been in an infected area in the last 14 days, are subject to compulsory isolation unless otherwise directed by the Senior Medical Officer. Your vaccination status and the number of people isolating together determine the length of compulsory isolation. \nThere are three tiers of compulsory isolation which are outlined on the <a href=\"https://www.ascension.gov.ac/revised-compulsory-isolation-protocols-introduced\">Ascension Island Government website</a>. During compulsory isolation, conditions are monitored for the development of symptoms which may be considered consistent with COVID-19. Air crews are also required to isolate for the duration of their stay on island. The Ascension Island Government will test all arrivals for COVID-19 within 3 days of arrival before they exit quarantine. <br>\nCountries currently defined as being an infected area are listed <a href=\"https://www.ascension.gov.ac/public-document/cv01n-notice-of-infected-areas-18-august-2020\">here</a>.\nDuring compulsory isolation, you will not be allowed to leave your accommodation unless directed to by local authorities or unless in an emergency. You will receive a daily welfare check from the local police detachment. <br>\nAll visitors to Tristan da Cunha require the authority of the Island Council in advance. Visitors to Tristan are currently restricted to returning Tristanians and expatriates on contract to the Government of Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da Cunha has banned all visits by cruise liners and yachts. The only boats going to Tristan da Cunha are the supply vessels from Cape Town which undergo strict quarantine/sanitisation procedures before leaving Cape Town. These vessels only run 8 times per year. <br>\n*Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: Ascension Island will accept your respective letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.\n*Transiting South Africa en route to St Helena / Ascension / Tristan da Cunha:  For more information on visas, contact the <a href=\"http://southafricahouseuk.com/\">South African High Commission</a>\n*Testing/Screening on Arrival: All arrivals to St Helena (except individuals from Ascension who have spent 14 days or more on the island prior to their flight) will be subject to compulsory quarantine for 10 days and will require a test at the beginning and end of quarantine to check they are free of COVID-19. For those arriving by ship/yacht time at sea will count towards the 10 days quarantine period. <br>\nAll arrivals to Ascension (except individuals from St Helena who have spent 14 days or more on the island prior to their flight) are subject to testing on arrival and compulsory isolation up to 14 days. If you feel unwell or develop COVID-19 symptoms during your journey, you should make the crew aware and they will ensure containment measures are implemented on arrival. <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\nInternal Restrictions:<br> \n*Travel in St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: There is currently a travel corridor between St Helena and Ascension. Individuals who have been resident on St Helena or Ascension for 14 days or more prior to their flight will be able to travel between the two islands without the requirement for quarantine. On Ascension, medical clearance by the Senior Medical Officer is required on arrival before quarantine is exempted.<br>\nIn St Helena, those arriving by air (except travellers from Ascension) must quarantine in a property deemed by the authorities to be appropriate for quarantine or they will be taken to a government quarantine facility where they will spend 10 days. They will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and again after 10 days. Any breach of quarantine may result in a fine. There is no requirement for face coverings and there are no social distancing measures in force. Once new arrivals have completed quarantine, and tested negative for COVID-19, there are no local restrictions on travel within St Helena. Visitors can use taxis, public transport or rental cars to explore the island. <br>\nGiven its extreme isolation and lack of visitors, there is currently no social distancing on Tristan da Cunha. <br>\nOn Ascension you must wear a face covering from your port of arrival until you reach your isolation accommodation. <br>\nAscension\u2019s Public Health (Coronavirus) (Temporary Measures) Regulations 2020, enables local authorities to enforce public health measures. The penalties for breaches of these Regulations consist of a fine and up to six months in prison. <br>\n*Accommodation: Hotels and other accommodation are open on St Helena.\nOn Tristan, the only accommodation is government guest houses, which have to be arranged via the Tristan da Cunha Tourism Department well ahead of any proposed visit. On Ascension, all accommodation available to rent privately remains open as usual and is suitable for use during any period of compulsory isolation. <br>\n*Public spaces and services: Public places and services are open as usual and there are no restrictions on large gatherings. However, should Covid-19 present itself on any of the Islands, the authorities have the power to close public places and limit public gatherings.\n\n\n\n",

        "info": "Latest News: Authorities in England will allow fully vaccinated travelers from EU and U.S to arrive without needing to quarantine from 2 August (Reuters, 28.07.2021). \n <br>\n  <br>\nInternational Restrictions: <br>\nAuthorities in the UK issued the new nation's COVID-19-related international entry restrictions for several countries effective 04:00 July 19. In accordance with the government's so-called \"traffic light\" system for foreign travel, various countries and territories are categorized as \"green,\" \"amber,\" or \"red\" in order of increasing COVID-19 transmission risk based on local disease activity and immunization rates. <br>\nWhen the newly scheduled modifications come into effect, Bulgaria and Hong Kong will move to the green list; Croatia and Taiwan, on the other hand, will move to the green watchlist indicating that these two countries might move to the green list soon. Spain's Balearic Islands and the British Virgin Islands will move to the amber list. At the same time, Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone will move to the red list. <br>\nTravelers arriving from green-listed countries are not required to quarantine unless a mandatory COVID-19 test taken on or before the second day after arriving in the UK returns a positive result. The green list includes Australia, Bermuda, Gibraltar, Madeira, Malta, New Zealand, Israel, Iceland, Singapore, Brunei, and several other UK overseas territories. <br>\nArrivals from amber countries must currently self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival and take COVID-19 tests on the second and eighth days of their quarantine periods. Health officials may perform spot checks to ensure compliance. Persons without suitable accommodations must stay at their own expense in facilities arranged by the government. All arrivals must fill out a passenger locator form providing contact details and travel history over the past 10 days. <br>\nBusiness travelers arriving from amber-listed countries will be permitted to temporarily leave self-isolation under limited circumstances for critical business purposes. The measure only applies to business executives who can demonstrate that their activity will benefit a UK-based organization employing at least 500 people; such executives must apply for approval to leave quarantine before travel and be subject to all other testing and quarantine requirements. <br>\nTravelers who have visited red countries within 10 days before arrival in the UK will be barred from entry. Countries on the red list include, but are not limited to, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, Kenya, Ethiopia, India, UAE, Argentina, Nepal, Qatar, Bangladesh, Philippines, Seychelles, and Pakistan. British and Irish nationals, visa holders, and permanent residents are exempt from the entry ban; however, all permitted arrivals from red-listed countries must self-isolate in a government-approved hotel quarantine facility for 10 days at their own expense. <br>\nAlso effective July 19, UK residents arriving from amber-designated countries who have been fully vaccinated under a state-approved program within the UK will no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England; they will, however, still need to provide a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival and submit to a confirmatory test within 48 hours after arrival. Additionally, children under the age of 18 arriving from amber countries will be exempt from quarantine. Children under the age of four will be exempt from testing requirements; those aged 5-10 must take a PCR test on day two after arrival, while those aged 11 to 18 will need to take a PCR test no more than 72 hours before departure and an additional test on day two after arrival. <br>\nAll international arrivals must present proof of having tested negative for COVID-19 before boarding their flights for the UK. Any persons arriving without such proof may be fined or denied entry. Arrivals from outside the British Isles and Ireland must be tested no more than 72 hours before departing their country of origin. Exemptions are in place for children under the age of 11, international rail and maritime crews, and certain other categories of travelers. Persons arriving from the British Overseas Territories of Saint Helena, Ascension Island, and the Falkland Islands are exempt. The government has issued online guidance on test criteria and details of certain traveler categories that are exempt. <br>\nAuthorities have introduced additional procedures for testing certain categories of international arrivals. The system uses lateral flow tests to identify cases, enabling these arrivals to avoid quarantine. The categories include commercial truckers, transport crew, seafarers, seasonal agricultural workers, and certain travelers engaged in essential activity supporting the national interest. Such arrivals will be required to take a test before the end of their second day in the UK; those staying in the UK for longer periods will be required to take two further tests every three days. <br>\nArrivals staying in the UK for fewer than two days will not require a test. Tests will be obtained through various means, including workplace and community testing programs, home-testing kits, and - for commercial truckers - testing sites situated along major routes. Individuals receiving a positive test must take a PCR test and self-isolate for 10 days. Arrivals from elsewhere in the British Isles and Ireland will not be subject to the requirements. <br>\nOfficials review these measures weekly or in response to significant changes in disease activity abroad. Authorities could reimpose, extend, further ease, or otherwise amend any restrictions with little-to-no notice depending on disease activity over the coming weeks. <br>\nFollow all official instructions. Abide by national health and safety measures. Reconfirm all travel arrangements. Consider delaying traveling if experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, as they may prompt increased scrutiny and delays. Arrive at the airport early to prevent your seat from being reallocated to a standby passenger. Liaise with trusted contacts for further updates and guidance. Ensure contingency plans account for further disruptive measures or extensions of current restrictions. <br>\n<br> <br> \nInternal Restrictions: <br> \n*Travel within the U.K.: Authorities have extended COVID-19 emergency measures until September. People who have symptoms or test positive are required to self-isolate for 10 days. Those who live with someone who either has symptoms or tests positive must self-isolate for 14 days.<br>\nAnyone who tests positive for COVID-19 or is notified of having been in contact with someone infectious and fails to self-isolate could face fines up to 10,000 GBP. <br>\nHealth authorities have advised individuals not to travel in and out of areas most impacted by the Indian COVID-19 variant. These areas include Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow, and North Tyneside.<br>\n*Face Mask: The use of face masks is mandatory in several public locations, including banks, supermarkets, train stations, airports, bus stations, universities, and on public transportation across the UK.

        "info": "Latest News: Authorities to extend strict COVID-19 restrictions in Hanoi until 22 August following detection of new cases (Reuters, 06.08.2021). Government will reduce duration of mandatory quarantine for foreign visitors from two weeks to seven days (Reuters, 04.08.2021). \n <br>\n <br>\n International Restrictions:<br>\n*Entry to Vietnam: Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers. <br>\n*Land borders: Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods and returning Vietnamese nationals. <br>\n*Transiting Vietnam: Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed. <br>\n*Data collection: Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel. <br>\n*Testing on departure: There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Quarantine is mandatory for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside Vietnam and for most coming to Vietnam Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. There are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. This is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. <br>\nThe Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. <br>\nVietnam\u2019s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Violations carry strict penalties. <br>\nQuarantine lasts a minimum of 7 days and will be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged from hospital after 10 days and have 2 back to back negative Covid tests. Following discharge you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation for 14 days and should follow the instructions issued by the local authorities. You should expect to be tested at least 3 times prior to release, and will be required to produce at least 2 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and may require further negative tests during self-isolation. Quarantine periods and testing requirements may change at short notice and may vary between locations. <br>\nOnce you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam. <br>\nVietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments. <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Internal Restrictions: <br>\n*Domestic travel: Air Travel: From 8 August until further notice all commercial domestic flights to and from areas under social distancing have been suspended. Check on the status of your flight with your travel provider before travelling.\n*Inter-province public transport: Most inter-provincial public transport services have been suspended and those still operating are likely to be heavily booked. Many provincial borders are closed. Transport services may be cancelled or suspended at short notice. You should check with your travel provider and/or local authorities before travelling including provisions for onward travel after disembarking. <br>\n*International travel: Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain very limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice. <br>\nYou should be alert to announcements from local authorities. <br> \nThere are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam which you should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.<br>\n*Public spaces and services: The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can be expected to increase and change at short notice. You should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities. You should also ensure that you have your ID /passport with you. Before travelling to another province you should check with your travel provider and/or accommodation what requirements are in place, both where you are travelling to and on return. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines. <br>\nHo Chi Minh City has extended social distancing measures under Directive 16 from 16 August until 15 September. Hanoi will apply them until 22 August. These periods may be further extended. <br>\nIn accordance with Directive 16, you should ensure you are strictly following the social distancing rules in place. These include but are not limited to: <br>\n\u2022        staying at home and only going outside for essential needs such as food shopping, obtaining medicine, or urgent medical services <br>\n\u2022        ban on gatherings of more than two people at public places <br>\n\u2022        suspension of public transportation including taxis, motorcycle taxis  and food delivery services <br>\n\u2022        ban on travelling to other localities <br>\nFrom 26 July until further notice, Ho Chi Minh City has imposed a curfew from 6pm to 6am. All residents must remain indoors except for emergency medical care. Shops and businesses must also remain closed. Other provinces and cities may impose similar curfews at short notice, so you should monitor local regulations for updates. <br>\nFrom 16 - 23 August Danang, and from 14 \u2013 21 August Nha Trang, have imposed strict lockdowns. Under this lockdown you are not allowed to go out, except for medical needs including vaccinations and tests and to travel to international airports. During this period all services and shops except for chemists will be closed. Food and essential supplies will be delivered to residential units (t\u1ed5 d\u00e2n ph\u1ed1). Please talk to your landlord or local ward authorities for details, as these may differ according to your ward. <br>\nYou can also obtain further advice on Danang from the Danang Visitor Centre hotline on 023 6355 0111. <br>\nAll those returning from Ho Chi Minh City to other provinces in Vietnam will be quarantined in state quarantine facilities for 14 days, be tested 3 times and must monitor their health for 14 days afterwards. Other provinces may also apply quarantine, social distancing measures and curfews at short notice and depending on where you are travelling from. You should check current measures in place at your destination before you travel. <br>\nHanoi authorities have deployed checkpoints at major gateways into Hanoi where officials will check temperatures and collect health declarations for those entering Hanoi. All those arriving in Hanoi from Ho Chi Minh City or areas with Covid outbreaks must provide a negative Covid PCR test taken within 72 hours and self-isolate for 14 days. <br>\nIf in doubt, check with your local authorities to make sure that you are in compliance and to avoid being fined. <br>\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. <br>\nPlan ahead and make sure you: can access money; understand what your insurance will cover; can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned \n\n",
