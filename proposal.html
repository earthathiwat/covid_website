        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us, there are many restrictions bestowed upon us. Having mandatory law
            on wearing masks, quarantine restrictions and many more regulations. Travellers have to be well-informed
            of these policies when they are making a decision to travel into another country. With our preliminary research, we
            found multiple websites that display information about COVID-19 statistics, regulations and travel
            restrictions in each country. For example, the CDC website provides us with the general statistics of
            COVID-19 in each country which allows us to determine whether it is safe for them to travel there.
            Another site, ourworldindata, shows us various maps which display restrictions and bans assessment due
            to COVID-19 in each country. Since many countries are imposing various restrictions due to many factors,
            such as which country are you departing from, it can be challenging and confusing for travellers to prepare themselves to travel
            to another country.

                article</a> just how complicated it can be for a traveller to fly during the pandemic given the stark differences in the already complicated travel policies of varying countries. Meanwhile,

            brings up the term "pandemic policy fatique" which arises from overwhelming guidelines and policies and causes people to break rules unintentionally. With
            this in mind and with all the data floating around the internet, we want to create a centralized
            and user-friendly information center for these travellers during the pandemic. Therefore, our goal is to use information technology to create an interactive website
            that will provide users with all the essential decision-making information.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Audiences</h3>
        <p>
            We want to create a multi-page interactive web application that will allow its users to make decisions
            for their upcoming trips. Our targeted audiences of the application would be those who are interested
            or need to travel into another country while pandemic situations are still unstable. This is because our
            website allows users to gather the exact information they need before preparing for their trip. The
            information that the users will be viewing will come from various reputable sources such as
            <a href="https://github.com/KFFData/COVID-19-Data/tree/kff_master/Country%20Trend%20Data">World Health
                Organization (WHO)</a>,
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html 
            ">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>,
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">ourworldindata</a>, and
            <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-global-travel-restrictions-and-airline-information">UN
                WFP's World Travel Restriction</a>
        </p>
        <h3>App Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our first page on the web app will be an interactive map where it provides information such as
                statistical
                information and main restrictions on the arrival country. The user will be expected to input their
                vaccination
                status and country of departure in order to generate more accurate information. Furthermore, we will
                allow
                our users to use filtering options so that it could eliminate countries that won’t allow their wants and
                needs. For example, some countries require 14 days of quarantine upon arrival or have a mask mandate in
                public areas which might not satisfy someone’s requirements.</li>
            <li>We understand that some users will want to make comparisons between multiple countries' data, therefore
                we will create a second page that will allow users to
                create comparison visualization in order to compare various COVID-19 statistics between two countries
                or more.</li>
            <li>Lastly, (if we have enough time for this project) in cases where the user has their own data,
                we can create a third page where the user can input their data and create visualizations based on our
                pre-made functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            This web app will solve the problem of having an overwhelming amount of uncentralized, not user-friendly
            information about COVID-19 which causes indecisiveness in deciding whether or not a country is safe to
            travel to. Our web app is the
            perfect solution to this because it ensures the user will have all the essential information used for their
            decision making which, of course, will also be user friendly.
